        <p class="aboutpara">The rugby ranking system was created in 2017 by a group of rugby fans and software geeks who wanted to be
            able to settle
            which rugby teams are better once and for all. League tables only tell so much and don't tell users about
            the leagues history
            and real performance of the teams. After all the team at the top of the table is not always the best team
            overall (although
            this is often the case).</p>

        <p class="aboutpara">The system uses a modified version of the ELO algorithm created by Arpad Elo, a Hungarian-born American
            physics professor.
            It is often used to rank chess players but has seen many alternative uses in sport and other areas. It's a
            pretty interesting
            algorithm and definitely worth checking out for those inclined. It also helped bring fame to a of the
            founder's of one off the worlds biggest
            tech companies, but we'll let you find out who for yourself!</p>
